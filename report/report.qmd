The COVID-19 pandemic has had dramatic and lasting effect on the United States, specifically in public health, society, and policy. Between the years of 2020 and 2023, over one million Americans have died due to COVID-19, with mortality patterns varying based on demographic groups, age, sex, region, and time frame. Being able to understand these patterns and how specific characterisitcs affected mortality rates is important in characterizing the impact of the pandemic and evaluating public health implementations to combat the virus. The purpose of this study is to analyze these mortality patterns utilizing provisional death counts provided by the Center of Disease Control (CDC) in addition to state level population estimations. Furthermore, assesing what factors played a strong role in COVID-19 death rates across the United States. 


A series of demographics and geographic factors are known to have affected the mortality rates for COVID-19. With the help of prior research of the Center Of Disease Control (CDC) and National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS), we know that the older generation seemed to have experienced significantly higher death counts, frequency increasing with age. Additionally, studied have shown that there is a higher mortality rate in men than women, potentially hinting at differences in comorbidity, immune response, and behavioral factors. Geographic variation has also been reported, where the South and Midwest seemed to have experienced mortality rates, potentially due to differences in vaccination rates, population density, healthcare policies, and the timeline of policy implementation. 


The primary dataset used in this study is "Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age", provided by the CDC. This file contains key variables such as monthly and yearly death count for each U.S state from 2020 to 2023, broken down further with supporting variables such as sex and age group. The dataset contains over 100,000 observations and CDC-supressed values (NA values) in low population subgroups in efforts to preserve confidentiality and avoid systematic bias. In order to estimate comparalbe mortality rates across the states and demographics, the data wa merged with 2020-2023 state population estimates from the U.S Census. By doing this, it allowed for the creation of key variables such as "COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 residents", enabling meaningful comparisons across different states and years. In addition to this, states were also grouped into four regions: West, MidWest, South, and Northeast to help aid geographic analysis. 


Our study aims to focus on four main objectives. First, we aim to analyze the patters in U.S COVID-19 using detailed analysis and graphical visualizations of death rates across all months from 2020 to 2023. Second, we aim to examine demographic patterns by analyzing deaths across age groups and sex. Third, we use visualizations such as heatmaps to depict state-level variation in COVID-19 death rates. Lastly, we utilize a variety of modeling approaches such as Multiple Linear Regression, Poisson Regression, Two-Way ANOVA, amongst a few others, to quantify the effects of year, region, age group, and sex on COVID-19 mortality. Ultimately, these analyses help to provide a comprehensive understanding of factors associated with COVID-19 death rates in the United States and show how mortality has changed over the course of the pandemic.
