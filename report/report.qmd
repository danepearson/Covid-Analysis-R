The COVID-19 pandemic has had dramatic and lasting effect on the United States, specifically in public health, society, and policy. Between the years of 2020 and 2023, over one million Americans have died due to COVID-19, with mortality patterns varying based on demographic groups, age, sex, region, and time frame. Being able to understand these patterns and how specific characterisitcs affected mortality rates is important in characterizing the impact of the pandemic and evaluating public health implementations to combat the virus. The purpose of this study is to analyze these mortality patterns utilizing provisional death counts provided by the Center of Disease Control (CDC) in addition to state level population estimations. Furthermore, assesing what factors played a strong role in COVID-19 death rates across the United States. 


A series of demographics and geographic factors are known to have affected the mortality rates for COVID-19. With the help of prior research of the Center Of Disease Control (CDC) and National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS), we know that the older generation seemed to have experienced significantly higher death counts, frequency increasing with age. Additionally, studied have shown that there is a higher mortality rate in men than women, potentially hinting at differences in comorbidity, immune response, and behavioral factors. Geographic variation has also been reported, where the South and Midwest seemed to have experienced mortality rates, potentially due to differences in vaccination rates, population density, healthcare policies, and the timeline of policy implementation. 


The primary dataset used in this study is "Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age", provided by the CDC. This file contains key variables such as monthly and yearly death count for each U.S state from 2020 to 2023, broken down further with supporting variables such as sex and age group. The dataset contains over 100,000 observations and CDC-supressed values (NA values) in low population subgroups in efforts to preserve confidentiality and avoid systematic bias. In order to estimate comparalbe mortality rates across the states and demographics, the data wa merged with 2020-2023 state population estimates from the U.S Census. By doing this, it allowed for the creation of key variables such as "COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 residents", enabling meaningful comparisons across different states and years. In addition to this, states were also grouped into four regions: West, MidWest, South, and Northeast to help aid geographic analysis. 


Our study aims to focus on four main objectives. First, we aim to analyze the patters in U.S COVID-19 using detailed analysis and graphical visualizations of death rates across all months from 2020 to 2023. Second, we aim to examine demographic patterns by analyzing deaths across age groups and sex. Third, we use visualizations such as heatmaps to depict state-level variation in COVID-19 death rates. Lastly, we utilize a variety of modeling approaches such as Multiple Linear Regression, Poisson Regression, Two-Way ANOVA, amongst a few others, to quantify the effects of year, region, age group, and sex on COVID-19 mortality. Ultimately, these analyses help to provide a comprehensive understanding of factors associated with COVID-19 death rates in the United States and show how mortality has changed over the course of the pandemic.

In order to understand how COVID-19 mortality varies across time, demographics groups, and U.S regions, we used a combination of exploratory visualization and statistical modeling techniques. Each method was selected accordingly to adhere to the structure of the dataset, count based, non-normally distributed outcomes with strong demographic groupings as well as address our main reserach question regarding geographic and demographic predictors of COVID-19 mortality. We conducted this analysis in R using the following packages: tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) for data manipulation and visualization, lubridate (Grolemund & Wichhamm, 2011) for date handling, ggplot (Wickham, 2016) for plotting, maps for state analysis, MASS (Venables & Ripley, 2002) for Negative Binomial modeling, and broom for model diagnostics. 

# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

As a baseline model we fit a multiple linear regression predicting standardized mortality rates:


$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Year}_i + \beta_2 \text{AgeGroup}_i +
\beta_3 \text{Sex}_i + \beta_4 \text{Region}_i + \varepsilon_i,
$$


We included 'Year' as a factor rather than a numeric variable because early exploratory analysis showed a non-linear decline in mortality rates over time. Mulitple Linear Regression provides estimates that quantify differences between demographics and geographic subgroups. Additionally, MLR assumes linearity between the predictors and outcomes, error homoscedasticity, and normally distributed residuals. We developed some diagnostic plots which indicated violations of linearity and constant variance, suggesting that linear regression may provide a biased standard error, pushing for the use of a count-based generalized linear model. 


# Poisson Regression

Since COVID-19 death counts are non-negative integers, Poisson was a great next step for us. We modeled observed COVID-19 deaths as:

$$
Y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i), 
\qquad
\log(\lambda_i) = 
\beta_0 
+ \beta_1 \text{Year}_i 
+ \beta_2 \text{AgeGroup}_i 
+ \beta_3 \text{Sex}_i 
+ \beta_4 \text{Region}_i 
+ \log(\text{Population}_i).
$$


The log link ensures that the predicted count values are positive, and the offset term log(Populationi) adjusts for differences in population size so that expected deaths scale according to the state's population. Poisson regression is appropriate when the variance and mean of the count data are similar, however, COVID-19 mortality data many times has a higher variance than mean, leading to bias estimations and our consideration for a model that is a bit more flexible.


# Negative Binomial Regression

Due to the overdispersion in mortality rate, we implemented a Negative Binomial generalized linear model using the MASS package. This model assumes:

$$
Y_i \sim \text{NegBin}(\mu_i, k), 
\qquad
\log(\mu_i) = X_i \beta + \log(\text{Population}_i),
$$

where \(k\) is the dispersion parameter. The Negative Binomial model incorporates an additional variance term:

$$
\text{Var}(Y_i) = \mu_i + \frac{\mu_i^2}{k}.
$$

making it a more flexible model in comparison to the Poisson model. This model was able to provide a better fit and lower AIC values, proving to be more reliable and a better predictor. 




# Two-Way ANOVA and Interaction Effects

To understand whether mortality differed based on age group, sex, and region, as well as understanding how these factors interacted, we conducted a Two-Way ANOVA. 
$$
Y_{ijk} = 
\mu 
+ \alpha_i(\text{AgeGroup}) 
+ \beta_j(\text{Sex}) 
+ \gamma_k(\text{Region}) 
+ (\alpha\beta)_{ij} 
+ (\alpha\gamma)_{ik} 
+ (\beta\gamma)_{jk} 
+ \varepsilon_{ijk}.
$$

ANOVA is great for comparing group means when the outcome is continuous. Although death count is discrete, our dependent variable was mean deaths conditional on demographic subgroups, making ANOVA valid for comparison of group level means. Not only this, but the significance of the Age Group x Sex interaction supported the conclusion that mortality differences across age groups depends on sex.


# Spatial and Panel Data Methods

Choropleth Mapping

We merged the CDC dataset with the U.S state polygons from the maps package to create a visualization for geographic variation in mortality rates. In order to do this, we had to standardize state names, convert populate estimates into long format, and compute yearly death rates per 100,000 residents. 


Panel Data Time-Series Plot

We developed a region-level panel dataset by aggregating monthly deaths and population counts across states within each region. This allowed us to create a visualization depicting month-to-month trends and regional differences. We also used ggplot2 to plot mortality trajectories, dedicating a line per region, allowing for clear interpretation, comparison, and pattern analysis. 


# Why These Methods

Using a combination of linear regression, Poisson and Negative Binomial linear models, ANOVA, and panel-data visualization allowed us to conduct a thorough analysis of this multidimentional dataset. We chose Poisson and Negative Binomial models since COVID-19 mortality is count-based, high skewed, and overdispersed, something that classic linear models would struggle to handle. ANOVA and visualizations helped to provide insightful subgroup comparisons. All in all, these methods aligned with our goals of quantifying differences across demographic groups, regions, and years, as well as indentifying which factors had strong influences on COVID-19 mortality between 2020 and 2023.

This study examined how COVID-19 mortality varied across demographic groups, geographic regions, and time in the United States from 2020 to 2023. By combining the CDC's provisional death counts with state level population estimates, we were able to evaluate death rates per 100,000 people and use regression modeling in addition to visualizations to identify the factors strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality. Ultimately, these findings consistantly showed that age group, sex, region, and year played significant roles in shaping mortality patterns.  


During our analysis, we noticed a few clear patters. Mortality peaked nationally in late 2020 and early 2021, with a sharp decline in mid-2021. Age was the strongest predictor of mortality, those over the age of 75 experienced higher death rates than younger groups. Males consistantly showed to have higher mortality in comparison to females. Regionally, the South showed elevated death rates, while regions such as the Northeast had very high early mortality followed by lower rates in later years. These trends are evident in the visualizations and further backed by our statistical models.

The regression models provided a form of additional support for these finding, while the Multiple Regression model helped in identifying relationships, and diagnostic checks showed potential violations of key assumptions. The Poisson model was able to capture the count based characteristics of the data, but was also able to show its strong overdispersion. The Negative Binomial model was the best fit for the data, showing that mortality decreased significantly over time, males had higher death rates compared to females, and regional differences were statisically significant. The Two-Way ANOVA further revealed that the effect of age group on mortality changed based on males and females, emphasizing the importance of demographic interactions.

All of these findings have meaningful implications for public health, for instance, the strong age related disparities emphasize the importance of ensuring that older adults are protected through the aid of vaccines, boosters, and early treatment access. Regional patters show that state-level health policy, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare capacities also influence COVID-19 mortality patterns. Being able to understand these differences can help create interventions for potential future public health emergencies. 

However, something to note is that this study does have its limitations, the CDC's provitional data includes supressed values for smaller populations, making it harder to gain insight from certain states or demographic groups. Additionally, important factor such as comorbidities, vaccination rates, and socioeconomic status were not included in the dataset, while state level analysis may also hide variation within states. 

In the future, we would like to use additional predictors like vaccination coverage, variant spread, or county-level data to better understand patterns. We would also like to use more advanced modeling approaches, for example, time series models, could help capture heirarchical structure more effectively. 

All in all, this analysis was able to provide a clear and statistical understanding of how COVID-19 mortality varied across demographic and geographic dimensions in the United States, providing insights that may help implement preventative or early intervention health strategies in the future.
