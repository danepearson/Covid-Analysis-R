&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic has had dramatic and lasting effect on the United States, specifically in public health, society, and policy. Between the years of 2020 and 2023, over one million Americans have died due to COVID-19, with mortality patterns varying based on demographic groups, age, sex, region, and time frame. Being able to understand these patterns and how specific characterisitcs affected mortality rates is important in characterizing the impact of the pandemic and evaluating public health implementations to combat the virus. The purpose of this study is to analyze these mortality patterns utilizing provisional death counts provided by the Center of Disease Control (CDC) in addition to state level population estimations. Furthermore, assesing what factors played a strong role in COVID-19 death rates across the United States. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of demographics and geographic factors are known to have affected the mortality rates for COVID-19. With the help of prior research of the Center Of Disease Control (CDC) and National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS), we know that the older generation seemed to have experienced significantly higher death counts, frequency increasing with age. Additionally, studied have shown that there is a higher mortality rate in men than women, potentially hinting at differences in comorbidity, immune response, and behavioral factors. Geographic variation has also been reported, where the South and Midwest seemed to have experienced mortality rates, potentially due to differences in vaccination rates, population density, healthcare policies, and the timeline of policy implementation. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary dataset used in this study is "Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age", provided by the CDC. This file contains key variables such as monthly and yearly death count for each U.S state from 2020 to 2023, broken down further with supporting variables such as sex and age group. The dataset contains over 100,000 observations and CDC-supressed values (NA values) in low population subgroups in efforts to preserve confidentiality and avoid systematic bias. In order to estimate comparalbe mortality rates across the states and demographics, the data wa merged with 2020-2023 state population estimates from the U.S Census. By doing this, it allowed for the creation of key variables such as "COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 residents", enabling meaningful comparisons across different states and years. In addition to this, states were also grouped into four regions: West, MidWest, South, and Northeast to help aid geographic analysis. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our study aims to focus on four main objectives. First, we aim to analyze the patters in U.S COVID-19 using detailed analysis and graphical visualizations of death rates across all months from 2020 to 2023. Second, we aim to examine demographic patterns by analyzing deaths across age groups and sex. Third, we use visualizations such as heatmaps to depict state-level variation in COVID-19 death rates. Lastly, we utilize a variety of modeling approaches such as Multiple Linear Regression, Poisson Regression, Two-Way ANOVA, amongst a few others, to quantify the effects of year, region, age group, and sex on COVID-19 mortality. Ultimately, these analyses help to provide a comprehensive understanding of factors associated with COVID-19 death rates in the United States and show how mortality has changed over the course of the pandemic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our original, unaltered "Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age" dataset from the CDC has 138,000 rows and 16 columns. The key columns we are focusing on for this project are "Group" (whether data was measured by Month, by Year, or Total), "Year", "Month", "State", "Sex", "Age Group", and "COVID.19.Deaths". Before conducting the main exploratory analysis, we exmined the number of missing values (NA) in each of the variables of interest. We did not count the number of missing values of the "Year" and "Month" columns, as they have missing values depending on whether the respective row was measured by year or by month. Each key column had no missing values, aside from "COVID.19.Deaths", which had 39,430 rows with no value.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, we explored how the frequency of deaths changed over time in the data, plotting the average total deaths across in the entire US for each month, from 2020-2023. We found that deaths from COVID-19 spiked drastically in late 2020 and early 2021, with the death rate lowering in mid 2021 and leveling off by early 2023.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline COVID-19 deaths in mid-2021 coincides with the release and administration of the vaccine, as more than 70% of the U.S. population had received at least one vaccine dose, and approximately 60% were fully vaccinated by this time. These developments may have contributed to the observed reduction in mortality, as vaccination has been shown to substantially decrease the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and transmission.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this was insightful, we wanted to dive deeper by examining the distribution of each month's COVID-19 deaths in the US, averaged across 2020-2023. By creating a boxplot for each month, a clear seasonal pattern was revealed: mortality was highest in December and January and lowest during the summer months, particularly June.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pattern indicates that higher COVID-19 mortality in the United States was associated with colder periods of the year, whereas lower mortality aligned with warmer periods. Seasonal factors may help explain this trend, as colder and drier conditions can weaken immune defenses and aid viruses in surviving longer. Increased time inside during colder months may have also promoted greater transmission of the COVID-19 virus.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we analyzed how COVID-19 mortality varied across the different age groups. We found that older ages were directly associated with increases deaths. Those age 85 and older accounted for 311,863 total COVID-19 deaths across all states from 2020-2023 in the United States, while individuals younger than 35 accounted for 16,735 COVID-19 deaths.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we examined how mortalities varied both temporally and spatially in the United States by creating a choropleth heatmap of the mortality rate of each state, for each year in the dataset. By joining our original dataset with data on 2020-2023 state population estimates from the U.S Census, we were able to calculate the COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people in each state. Our heatmap revealed that in 2020 and 2021, mortality rates were higher and demonstrated substantial variation across states, with states in the Midwest, South, and Northeast exhibiting the highest rates. By 2022, overall mortality levels declined across the United States, though southern states still maintained higher mortality rates. In 2023, mortality rates were lower nationwide with little-to-no variation between states. These spatial-temporal patterns display both the nationwide decrease in COVID-19 mortality over time along with consistent regional differences.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary patterns in the data indicated that year, region, age group, and sex were important sources of variability in COVID-19 mortality. The substantial variation across states and demographic groups drove us to use modeling approaches suited for count data and population-standardization.
